		#ExodusSolis-hype-drill-mini-titl = 2.0 Hyper Crystal Miner
		#ExodusSolis-hype-drill-mini-desc = Mass popularity has inspired Exodus to create Hyper crystals, Crystals with a negative mass! Patent pending.  These crystals can be mined for and converted into Ion.

		#ExodusSolis-hype-drill-radial-titl = 2.0 Hyper Crystal Miner
		#ExodusSolis-hype-drill-radial-desc = Mass popularity has inspired Exodus to create Hyper crystals, Crystals with a negative mass! Patent pending.  These crystals can be mined for and converted into Ion.

		#ExodusSolis-hype-engine-charged-titl = 1.0 Charge Hyper Engine
		#ExodusSolis-hype-engine-charged-desc = This new engine type will revolutionize space travel with a new "Supercharging" method that makes for more thrust at a higher effectiveness

		#ExodusSolis-hype-engine-hyper-gen-2-titl = 1.0 Interspace/Interstellar Hyper Engine
		#ExodusSolis-hype-engine-hyper-gen-2-desc = A high performance Hyper engine with a variable geometry thrust vectoring nozzle and an Interspace/Interstellar mode for extra thrust.  This is by far the most advanced and versitile engine for space travel and warfare.  Jeb does not know about this and if he finds out... Have mercy on our souls... particularly the one whose responsibility is to keep that from happening.

		#ExodusSolis-hype-engine-ion-0625-titl = 1.0 Hyper engine
		#ExodusSolis-hype-engine-ion-0625-desc = Its expensive yeah, but one fighter... erm... space plane can get all of your exploration for the military done with no more expense or hardship!  Just keep Jeb away...

		#ExodusSolis-hype-engine-ion-cond-titl = 1.0 Condensed Hyper Engine
		#ExodusSolis-hype-engine-ion-cond-desc = After Exodus failed to deliver on his promise (Sorry he forgot about putting that into 1.7, contracts were a priority) he has now delivered on a very special engine that can function for either more Power or more Delta-V!

		#ExodusSolis-hype-rcs-titl = ION RCS Thruster Block
		#ExodusSolis-hype-rcs-desc = This thruster block follows the exact same principles as the RCS block, but uses ION fuel instead for a more uses such as... uh... Rocket Stuff...

		#ExodusSolis-hype-reactor-125-titl = 1.25 Ion Reactor
		#ExodusSolis-hype-reactor-125-desc = Ion producing Reactor

		#ExodusSolis-hype-reactor-250-titl = 2.5m Ion Reactor
		#ExodusSolis-hype-reactor-250-desc = Ion producing Reactor

		#ExodusSolis-hype-sas-inline-125-titl = Hyperdrive Inline Stabilizer
		#ExodusSolis-hype-sas-inline-125-desc = Inline capable of stableizing even a hyperdrive.  Or creating enough GEE's to knock out Jeb.

		#ExodusSolis-hype-tank-ion-cond-titl = Condensed Ion Fuel Tank
		#ExodusSolis-hype-tank-ion-cond-desc = This tank is designed to circulate concentrated Ion fuel through magnetic suspension via a new hyper crystal lining as to avoid detonation while maintaining a convienient storage of mass Ion fuel...  Due to this, It cannot store Hyper Crystal

		#ExodusSolis-hype-tank-ion-titl = 2.0 Ion fuel tank
		#ExodusSolis-hype-tank-ion-desc = This stuff is very powerful. Do not leave near open flames, sparks, radiation of any type and Jeb.  2.0!
