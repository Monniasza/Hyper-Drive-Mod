## Version 2.5.0.0-release `<Special THE RETURN OF EXODUS>`

* 17 Apr 2020
* Kerbal Space Program 1.9.1
* by [ExodusSolis](https://github.com/ExodusSolis)

### 20k Special THE RETURN OF EXODUS

* reduces file size from 5MB to just 10kB.
* resized to 1.25m
  * Gen 1 Hyperdrive
  * Condensed Ion Fuel Tank
  * Hyperdrive Stabilizer
  * Ion Fuel Tank

BABY IM BACK!!!  So, I crunched all the numbers to completely redesign each engine's specifications, now it uses more realistic numbers. Not that this is realistic at all.  But for example, ion weighs in proportion to IRL electricity and is propelled out the back at the speed of light (or lower dependant on ISP/engine).  Also, I removed the stupid hyper crystals.  Those are stupid.  Comment away, but they are.

So everyone... enjoy!!!

* Issues
  * updates #7 - Archival Releases
  * closes #26 - 2.5.0.0
  * updates #55 - [BUG] Archival Releases

## Version 2.4.0.0-release `<10K Special>`

* 02 May 2019
* Kerbal Space Program 1.7.0
* by [ExodusSolis](https://github.com/ExodusSolis)

* Remove all past versions and replace in the destination.

* 10k Special

### MASSIVE UPDATE

* New Hyper Crystals!  With a negative mass!  
  * These crystals are stored in your typical Hyper tank; however, now the tanks weigh a more realistically insane amount because of the advanced tech storing the ION fuel.  To compensate, you can spend a pretty penny for hyper crystals to lower the mass from 50 to 0.25.
  * Broke?  Miser?  Not a problem!  With the new Hyper Crystal miner, you can mine these valuable commodities with some ION!
* New values for parts
* New features for certain modules such as the ISRU
* Removed Contract system (It never worked as intended)
* Next Update Spoiler:  New electrical parts to soak ION from space, New Modules for better craft control.

* Issues
  * updates #7 - Archival Releases
  * closes #25 - 2.4.0.0
  * updates #55 - [BUG] Archival Releases

## Version 1.7.0.0-release `<Archival>`

* 11 Jul 2018
* Kerbal Space Program 1.4.3
* by [ExodusSolis](https://github.com/ExodusSolis)

### HUGE UPDATE

* New contracts (Beta-contracts still need some balancing) when at higher rep.
* Altered costs of some parts.
* Contract tips
  * Currently the contracts give MORE than enough to cover the expense, BUT make sure you have nanolathing researched
  * If you are running short on funds, just lower the amount of fuel in the satellite! (Ion is VERY expensive)

---

## Version 1.6.0.0-release `<Archival>`

* by [ExodusSolis](https://github.com/ExodusSolis)

* 1.5 had multiple balance issues and thus was removed.
* 1.6 is the Prime release with a new fuel called condensed hyper fuel which can be turned into normal hyper fuel using the reactor to improve your Delta-v but at a sufficiently high cost.
* In 1.7 there will be new engines that can run on condensed hyper fuel for absolutely insane force at gen 2 level efficiency.
* If any good ideas are given in the comments  below they may be implemented.  (Note all parts are made from stock models)

* Issues
  * updates #7 - Archival Releases
  * closes #17 - 1.6.0.0
